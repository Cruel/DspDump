This is a simple 3DS utility app to dump the DSP binary component needed for audio output in many 3DS homebrew applications.

You need to merely open using the Homebrew Launcher, or any other method using *hax 2.0+. It will dump the needed file onto your SD card (/3ds/dspfirm.cdc), and you're ready. It only needs to be launched once.
